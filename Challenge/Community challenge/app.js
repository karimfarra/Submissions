              <p><strong id="red">Right now</strong>, Australia is burning. The nation is being ravaged by the most devastating bushfire season the country has ever seen.
              </p>
            
              <p>
              <strong>So far, more than 10 million hectares of Australian land have been burned. That’s equivalent to the whole country of Austria. At least 25 people have died and over 2,000 homes lost.
              </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
              It’s been estimated that over one billion animals have been killed nationally. This includes thousands of koalas, kangaroos. wallabies and other iconic species being burnt alive, and many thousands more injured and homeless.
